Getting Campaign IDs
====================

Campaign IDs are simple, but you must have a [token](https://tiltify-commands.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/tokens/) beforehand.

If you have a token setup, you can run `/campaigns <username>` to get campaign ids. When you run this command, two things will show up in the following format `NAME (Copy)` the name will be the campaign name, if you click on the campaign name, it will open a url of the campaign to make sure it is the right one selected! If that is the campaign you are looking for, click on "Copy" and it will copy the id to your clipboard.
