Creating Tokens
===============

Creating tokens for Tiltify Commands is relativily easy, however it requires some steps beforehand...

If you have a Fundraiser account, you can skip to steps 7-13.

1. Login to your Tiltify account
2. Go to your dashboard
3. Click "Become a Fundraiser!"
4. Fill out your information (nothing is required to continue)
5. Click "Upgrade account"
6. Reload the page completely
7. Click on "My Account"
8. Click on "Connected accounts"
9. Click on "Your applications" on the sidebar
10. Click on "Create applications"
11. Name your application
12. Set the "Redirect urls" to "https://example.com"
13. Copy your "Access token" from "Application Keys"

This is what you should see:

|                  |                                                                    |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Application ID` | `bc39f237d95f8eXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` |
