Tiltify Commands is a plugin for Paper/Spigot, which allows server owners to modify what commands get executed when a user donates on [Tiltify](https://tiltify.com/).

Requirements
------------

Tiltify Commands requires **Spigot** to work. Bukkit does not work. [Purpur](https://purpurmc.org/) and [Paper](https://papermc.io/) works too!
